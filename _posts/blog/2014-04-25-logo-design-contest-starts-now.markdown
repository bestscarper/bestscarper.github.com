Despite being a small company, I'm happy to take on multiple work streams.  Several years of various agile environments has given me a real insight into how to manage multiple work streams.

I'm still primarily an engineer.

So apart from my first work stream developing for Sky's new OTT video backend, I need to develop a company site and brand.

Tracy chose the name 'Belle Software' after our Labradoodle puppy and we agreed it fitted the bill.

####Choosing a website technology

I need to advertise my wares (ok... services) but there's a point.  However I also want to consolidate and practice what I have learned about site manangement.

* I want to steer clear of dynamic or CMS-driven - they're hard work and fragile. Having a database is millstone, even if it's wrapping in a CMS.
* Version Control (VCS) is essential.
* A client framework is essential to making the site usable across platforms. I cut my teeth on Twitter Bootstrap recently so that's what I'd like to stick with for now.
* The logic choice for many devs in my position is Jekyll, despite many carps about its limitations.  I can also make use of github.io linked with a custom domain.
* Other people are better at site design that me - I'm good at reusing and repurposing.

I found a gem in a [Jekyll port](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/solid/) of the [Solid theme](http://blacktie.co/2014/05/solid-multipurpose-theme/).
